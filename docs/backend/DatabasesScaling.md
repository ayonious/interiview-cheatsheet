# Horizontal Scaling

- Add more machines
- Cheap
- Harder to parallelize works
- Typical example is distributed dv

# Vertical Scaling

- Add more CPU in the same machine
- Expensive
- Easier because same machine will process works
- Typical example is using a bigger machine for database to avoid sharding
