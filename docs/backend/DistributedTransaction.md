### Normal Transaction

A block of code where some data change is done. All this change will be done in one go. Either all change will be done or none of them will be done.

### Distributed Transaction

- When it started?
  Specially in Microservices where each request in each microservice makes a change in their own database its very hard to just do one change in all the Dbs at the same time.

- Good example?
  Payment + Booking + Reservation + Ticket Reservation System
