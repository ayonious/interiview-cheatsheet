# SQL

- Data stored as form of Tables

# NoSQL

- Data stored as form of objects (probably JSON)

# When SQL Better than NOSQL

- SQL is easy to setup
- SQL is very fast for small amount of data
- SQL databases are meant to be joined together to get a bigger amount of data. This linking is done really good in SQL

# When noSQL Better than SQL

- Scaling up noSQL is lot better
- Adding a new column does not require much effort. Its just a new field in json object
