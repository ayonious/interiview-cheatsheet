I realized this phase is quite Randomized. Some recruiters don't even know what they are looking for. It could be they want someone with 5 years of experience on a Technology that was invented 4 years ago.

Don't expect recruiters to clearly explain you a lot of things always. Sometimes they are very much in a hurry and sometimes they take time.

# Preparation

- Find the Job description and read it carefully.
- Have your CV prepared (the one you sent) I always keep my Linked In Update so that there is no confusion
- Make sure you have a good quiet background and very attentive.
- Study their Product
- Study their economic situation in Crunchbase.
- Study people working there in LinkedIn. Maybe some of your old colleagues are working there.
- How is the experience in App and Mobile?
- Check what they are doing on Opensource Projects.

## Common questions to be ready with

- Why you want to change your job now?
- Why you want to work for us?
  - Competetive Salary
  - Opensource Community
  - Growing Opportunity
  - Intersting Business
- What are you looking for in your new job?
- What do you want to become?
  - Manger
  - Architect

## Common questions you can ask

- Tell me more about your business.
- Tell them that you liked their Product. Would be good if you are already a user and tell them your user experience. Find some problems in their Product for example maybe you had issues during Payment as they don't support some payment methods. (EC card or Paypal) Make sure this is not super in details but something a recruiter will be able to understand and see that you have interest
- How many customers do you have?
