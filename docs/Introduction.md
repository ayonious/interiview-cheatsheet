- whats the difference between deadlock and race conditions?
- In which case would you prefer using a SQL database instead of noSQL?

These are all the very common questions during interview. I know the answer of it all but because of my memory Problem (which the interviewer never believes) I often need lot more time answering.

## Please note

- This is not some trainer guide.
- This is my handy cheatsheet for tech interview. Everything written here are things I already know so please dont expect super detailed explanation.
- I hope you (myself mostly) take a look at these before interview
