# Interview Cheatsheet

> My interview Preparation Guide. Having Interview preparation guide is against my will

## 🤷 But Why another Guide?

This one is my personal one. So only contains things that I need to learn or just take a look. For example I dont really have interest much on Java or Python so those are not included here. But this has very detailed discussions on Nodejs async operations / Event-loopy-doopy.

Another reason Why I wrote it is because I was forgetting many basic things without much Practice. For example when is SQL better than noSQL. I know the reason but its better to read it once before Interveiw than trying to hard remember and then timing out
